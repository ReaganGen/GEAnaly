the user-customized threshold}
\usage{
extractSignificantGene(
  diffExpressionResult = NULL,
  filePath = NULL,
  save = FALSE,
  pValue = 0.05,
  foldChange = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{diffExpressionResult}{A DESeqResults object, a simple subclass of
DataFrame defined by DESeq2. It contains the columns: baseMean,
log2FoldChange, lfcSE, stat, pvalue and padj, and also includes
metadata columns of variable information. This input is the output
of function diffExpressionAnalysis. Default value is NULL.}

\item{filePath}{A character string path to the directory that the user want
to store the significant genes selected by the p value and fold change
threshold. It is recommended to create a new directory to store the output
.csv file. Default value is NULL. Should in the format:
"/Path/to/the/directory".}

\item{save}{A boolean value to indicate if store the result into a file
at the file path. If set to TRUE, the output would be stored at the
filePath. Default value is FALSE.}

\item{pValue}{A positive double, which is the threshold set by the
users used to filter genes that are differentially expressed in different
samples. Only genes that has smaller p values than the threshold would be
regarded as significant genes. Default value is 0.05. pValue is used to
measure if a difference is significant. The pValue should be a value
between 0 and 1.}

\item{foldChange}{A positive integer, which is the threshold set by the users
used to filter genes that are differentially expressed in different
samples. Only genes that has larger absolute values of fold change than
the threshold would be regarded as genes express differently. Default
value is 2. Fold change is a measure describing how much the expression
levels of genes change between different samples.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame, which is a subset of the input dataframe
"diffExpressionResult", containing the genes that have significantly
different expression level in different samples (based on the input
thresholds). It also contains the columns: baseMean, log2FoldChange,
lfcSE, stat, pvalue and padj, and also includes
metadata columns of variable information.
}
\description{
This is a function that select genes that have significantly different
expression levels in different samples according to the p value and
fold change provided by the users. As long as the gene has smaller p value
than the p value threshold and has larger fold change value than the
fold change threshold inputted by the users, these genes are regarded as
genes with significantly different expression levels in different samples.
The function save these significant genes into a .csv file.

# Using example differential expression analysis result

\dontrun{

# Filter out genes with significantly different expression levels
# This creates a significant_de_genes.csv file stores the result
