\title{Generate a volcano plot for the differential expression analysis result}
\usage{
visDeAnaly(
  genes = NULL,
  logFCT = 2,
  padjT = 0.05,
  maxOverlap = 15,
  filePath = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genes}{A data frame, which has a column called "group",
indicating if the gene is up expressed or down expressed or no change for
its expression. The output of function "labelGenes" is a good example.}

\item{logFCT}{A positive integer, the log fold change threshold used to
select genes with significant large differences in expression levels.
Default value is 2.}

\item{padjT}{A positive double between 0 and 1, used to select genes with
significant differences in expression levels. Default value is 0.05.}

\item{maxOverlap}{The max number of labels of genes in the figure that can
overlap. Exclude text labels that overlap too many things. Defaults to 15.}

\item{filePath}{A character string path to the directory that the user want
to store the visualization of the differential expression analysis result.
It is recommended to create a new directory to store the output .png file.
Default value is NULL. Should in the format: "/Path/to/the/directory/".}
}
\value{
A NULL, save the output visualization plot to "filePath"
}
\description{
This is a function that can visualize the differential expression analysis
result as a volcano plot, whose x-axis is "Log2(Fold change)" and y-axis is
"-Log10(P.adj)". Basically, the larger the value of -Log10(P.adj) and the
absolute value of Log2(Fold change) are, the more significant the gene
expression differences between samples are.
