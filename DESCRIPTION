Description: GEAnaly is an R package that implements a pipeline, 
    which integrates gene differential expression analysis, 
    gene enrichment analysis and gene correlation analysis, 
    for the analysis of gene expression matrix data and visualization of 
    the results of each analysis in the pipeline. The whole analysis pipeine
    can be executed in a single command efficiently.
